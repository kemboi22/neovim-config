# NVIM

The perfect blazingly fast Neovim configuration for myself, combining the aesthetics of [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) with the LSP, formatter and lint configurations from [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Getting started

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:wochap/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
$ nvim
```

**IMPORTANT:** I disabled nvim syntax which caused severe lag in my system, you can re enable commenting the autocmd `disable_nvim_syntax` in `lua/custom/plugins/coding.lua:64`, alternatively, you can install the Treesitter parser for the specified language.

### Vue projects

Create a file `.volar` in the root of your project to disable typescript-tools and enable tsserver, only tsserver can use @vue/typescript-plugin for now...

## Troubleshooting

- Anything Eslint related

  Run in nvim

  ```
  :w
  :e
  ```

  If that didn't work, kill all eslint processes

## Tips to learn to use this nvim config

- Learn [https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), then remove all lazy.nvim plugin specs that you are not going to use in `lua/custom/plugins/*`. For example, if you don't use neorg remove `neorg.lua`, if you don't code zig, remove `lang-zig.lua`. If you don't use Kitty, remove `mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim` and `mrjones2014/smart-splits.nvim`.
- Keymaps are located in `lua/custom/keymaps.lua` (global), `lua/custom/plugins/lsp/keymaps.lua` (active when an LSP server is running), and within each plugin spec.
- If you need autoformatting on save, create an autocmd that calls `conform.nvim`.
- Formatting, linting, and LSP config are the same as in Lazyvim, so feel free to import extras from Lazyvim, and add LSP servers in the same manner you did in Lazyvim.
- If you use a different theme than catppuccino, replace the plugin spec in `lua/custom/plugins/colorscheme/init.lua`. Also, update the configurations for lualine, bufferline, and lazy.nvim.
- To reduce startup time, lazily load `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter` on "LazyFile" or "VeryLazy". However, this may cause the code to momentarily appear without correct colors for a few milliseconds. The nvim startuptime on my computer is approximately 30ms, and with `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter` lazily loaded, it is around 25ms.

Lastly read all lua files ðŸ˜…, starting from `lua/custom/init.lua`
